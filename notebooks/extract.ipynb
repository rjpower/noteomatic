    "         Sidenotes are like footnotes, except they don’t force the reader to jump their eye to the bottom of the page, but instead display off to the side in the margin. Perhaps you have noticed their use in this document already. You are very astute.\n",
    "     </p>\n",
    "     <p>\n",
    "         Sidenotes are a great example of the web not being like print. On sufficiently large viewports, Tufte CSS uses the margin for sidenotes, margin notes, and small figures. On smaller viewports, elements that would go in the margin are hidden until the user toggles them into view. The goal is to present related but not necessary information such as asides or citations <em>as close as possible</em>\n",
    "         to the text that references them. At the same time, this secondary information should stay out of the way of the eye, not interfering with the progression of ideas in the main text.\n",
    "     </p>\n",
    "     <p>Sidenotes consist of two elements: a superscript reference number that goes inline with the text, and a sidenote with content. To add the former, just put a label and dummy checkbox into the text where you want the reference to go, like so:</p>\n",
    "     <pre>\n",

    "s=\"margin-toggle\"/&gt;</code>\n",
    "     </pre>\n",
    "     <p>\n",
    "         You must manually assign a reference <code>id</code>\n",
    "         to each side or margin note, replacing “sn-demo” in the <code>for</code>\n",
    "         and the <code>id</code>\n",
    "         attribute values with an appropriate descriptor. It is useful to use prefixes like <code>sn-</code>\n",
    "         for sidenotes and <code>mn-</code>\n",
    "         for margin notes.\n",
    "     </p>\n",
    "     <p>\n",
    "         Immediately adjacent to that sidenote reference in the main text goes the sidenote content itself, in a <code>span</code>\n",
    "         with class <code>sidenote</code>\n",
    "         . This tag is also inserted directly in the middle of the body text, but is either pushed into the margin or hidden by default. Make sure to position your sidenotes correctly by keeping the sidenote-number label close to the sidenote itself.\n",
    "     </p>\n",
    "     <p>\n",
    "         For optimal readibility of sidenotes, enclose the main text in the <code>section</code>\n",

    "         On large screens, a margin note is just a sidenote that omits the reference number. This lessens the distracting effect taking away from the flow of the main text, but can increase the cognitive load of matching a margin note to its referent text. However, on small screens, a margin note is like a sidenote except its viewability-toggle is a symbol rather than a reference number.
